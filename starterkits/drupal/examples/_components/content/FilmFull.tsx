/**
 * Fragment for the film detail page. In addition to getting all the basic
 * fields we need from the content type, the fragment includes the possible
 * paragraphs (using the fragment above). As you can see throughout the examples,
 * fragments can be nested one inside the other until you finally get to the
 * page level, where you want to run the query.
 *
 * The poster field is a Media entity of type Image. The query retrieves both
 * the URL to the original image and the URL, width, and height of a specific
 * image style (also called Poster). In this example, we're using the original
 * image as-is in the hero and the scaled and cropped version as a thumbnail.
 *
 * Note that we're retrieving a regular image style here, not a responsive image
 * style. If you use the next/image component to render the image and provide
 * the sizes attribute, Next.js will take care of the responsive aspect. Thus,
 * you probably want your image style in Drupal to be whatever the largest size
 * is that you'll need.
